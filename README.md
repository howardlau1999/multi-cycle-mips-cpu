# Multi-cycle MIPS CPU

This is one of the labs of Computer Organization Principle course at Sun Yat-sen University. This is a slightly modified version based on [Single-cycle MIPS CPU](https://github.com/howardlau1999/single-cycle-mips-cpu).

NOTE: This is NOT a standard MIPS implementation and is NOT compatible with any MIPS assemblers. The instructions are designed by professor and very different from those of standard MIPS code.
